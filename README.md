<h1>üè¢ Traction Solutions ‚Äì Centralized Network Integration</h1>

> üì° A full enterprise network design and integration project connecting four South African city branches with centralized administration and optimized traffic management.

---



## üß† Project Summary

Designed and implemented a centralized network infrastructure for Traction Solutions, connecting branches in Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein using VLANs, RIP v2 routing, centralized DHCP, and WAN leased lines. Security, scalability, and traffic prioritization were key design goals.

---

## üõ† Technologies & Concepts Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **RIP v2 Routing Protocol**
- **VLAN Segmentation & Inter-VLAN Routing**
- **Centralized DHCP Server (Bloemfontein)**
- **WAN Leased Line Connections (Point-to-Point)**
- **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Setup**
- **QoS for Traffic Prioritization**

---

## üß© Environment Overview

- **Johannesburg Office**: 3 VLANs ‚Äî Finance (VLAN 10), Sales (VLAN 20), HR (VLAN 30)
- **Cape Town Office**: 2 VLANs ‚Äî Warehouse (VLAN 100), Manufacturing (VLAN 200)
- **Durban Office**: OFFICE LAN setup
- **Bloemfontein Office**: DHCP Server, Mail Server, centralized services
- **Internet Access**: Web Server hosted externally (200.20.20.10)

I configured all routers with the IP addresses as specified in the table and tested connectivity between
the routers. Im choosing to just showcase JHB_R1's results to avoid making this READ long. All the Routers have the same or similar results.

PC3 of Vlan 10 in JHB can ping: <br/>
‚Ä¢	PC4 of Vlan 20 with IP 192.168.2.4 <br/>
‚Ä¢	PC7 of Vlan 200 with IP 192.168.200.3 in CPT <br/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/AcdfhH6.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="VLAN Configuration"/>
PC6 of Vlan 100 in CPT can ping: <br/>
‚Ä¢	PC9 of Vlan 200 with IP 192.168.200.4 <br/>
‚Ä¢	PC5 of Vlan 30 with IP 192.168.3.4 in JHB <br/>


<br/><br/>
Centralized DHCP Server Setup: <br/>

<img src="https://imgur.com/W8IHcmX.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="Central DHCP"/>

Configured the DHCP Server with a static IP address and the pools to assign IP addresses and other
parameters to JHB, DBN and CPT computers. The Default pool (serverpool) assigns IP addresses to devices that are in
the local Subnet (BLM).

 ps. Again just using JHB_R1 to make the read shorter, all the Routers have the same or similar configurations

<br/><br/>
QoS Implementation for VoIP and Video Conferencing: <br/>
**This part of the project was theoretical so, I used the Johannesburg and Durban networks to illustrate my answer:** <br/>

For JHB_R1 and DBN_R1 <br/>
 Identify and mark traffic types. <br/>
Set priorities and bandwidth for each traffic type. <br/>
As for Interface Configuration, we should apply QoS policies to the outbound interface connecting to DBN_R1 in JHB_R1. In DBN_R1 we should apply QoS policies to the outbound interface connecting to JHB_R1. <br/>

QoS Configuration Details <br/>
Priority Queueing: <br/>
Traffic Type: VoIP, Video Conferencing <br/>
Priority: High <br/>
Class-Based Weighted Fair Queueing: <br/>
Traffic Type: Standard Data <br/>
Priority: Medium <br/>
Low-Latency Queueing: <br/>

Traffic Type: Real-time traffic <br/>
Priority: Highest <br/>

<br/><br/>
ACL Configuration: <br/>
**In this project a constraint that was present was that users of all regions except the Manufacturing VLAN will have access to the WebServer and Mail server.** <br/>
